Comparative Genomic Analysis of Nipah Virus Strains 
The goal is to identify sequence variation and phylogenetic relationships between NiV isolates from different outbreaks (e.g. Malaysia, Bangladesh & singapore and India)
Fasta sequences can be downloaded direclty from NCBI, I have added a python code file to retrive sequence for bangladesh region as the search results were more, you can feel free to copy the code
