🧬 Comparative Genomic Analysis of Nipah Virus Strains

This project analyzes complete cds Nipah virus genomes from India, Bangladesh & singapore, and Malaysia. It uses multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction to identify evolutionary differences.

 🔧 Tools Used
- NCBI GenBank
- MAFFT (Multiple Sequence Alignment)
- MEGA (Phylogenetic Tree)
- Biopython (Data retrieval)

 📁 Folders
- `original data files/`: Raw FASTA files from NCBI
- `aligned fasta/`: Aligned sequences
- `niv virus tree/`: Newick tree + PNG of phylogeny
- `scripts/`: Bioython used
- `report/`: Summary of findings
- To veiw the aligned file https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/spool/_msaviewer.250528174429356rV5xAE2ydtzm9uc1OsRaHlsfnormal.html 


 📊 Key Results
- Aligned 10 NiV strains
- Found SNPs in the [G/F] gene
- Indian strains are closer to Bangladesh than Malaysia in tree
