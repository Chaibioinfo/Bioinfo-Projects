Introduction

Nipah virus belongs to Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family and is a zoonotic virus with a high case fatality rate. It was first recognized in humans in the Malaysian village of Kampung Sungai Nipah in 1998, initiating a deadly outbreak that lasted through 1999. Nipah virus was first isolated from patients with encephalitis during a 1998â€“99 epidemic among pig farmers in Malaysia, during which pigs were identified as the source of human infections. Since then, other outbreaks have been reported in south Asia, including in western and northwestern Bangladesh, over the Bangladeshâ€“India border in West Bengal, and in Kerala, India. 
The goal of this project is to perform a comparative genomic analysis of Nipah virus (NiV) strains isolated from different outbreaks, including India, Bangladesh & Singapore, and Malaysia. By aligning their nucleotide sequences and constructing a phylogenetic tree, this study aims to: 

* Compare the genetic similarity and divergence among NiV strains across regions
* Identify mutations and conserved regions that may influence viral function or evolution
* Explore evolutionary relationships to infer patterns of geographic spread and strain origin
* Build a visual phylogenetic tree to illustrate how the strains cluster and differ over time

Methods
Data Retrieval:
Sequences were downloaded from NCBI GenBank using Biopython. Only complete CDS sequences from Indian, Bangladesh & singapore, and Malaysian strains were collected.

Multiple Sequence Alignment:
Performed using MAFFT. Aligned FASTA file was generated and used for further analysis.

Phylogenetic Tree Construction:
A Neighbor-Joining tree was built using MEGA software to determine evolutionary relationships.

Results
Total sequences analyzed: 81
Length of aligned region: ~X bp

Number of SNPs or mutations observed: X (describe a few)

Tree Findings:

Indian strains cluster closer to [Bangladesh/Malaysia]

Strain [XYZ] showed the highest divergence

Bootstrap values (if used) indicate strong/weak confidence in certain branches
